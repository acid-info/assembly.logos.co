# Toolkit: Organise your own Logos Assembly local event

Logos Assembly is a series of grassroots community meetups planned and coordinated by globally-distributed Logos core contributors with the help of community volunteers.

(Similar to: [Activist handbook](https://activisthandbook.org/organising/protest), [DevCon Grants](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/devcon-grants), [Filecoin Ambassadors](https://hub.fil.org/orbit))

We aim to support awareness to our movement, cultivate belonging of our community, and accelerate the Logos movement by regular activations across the world.
